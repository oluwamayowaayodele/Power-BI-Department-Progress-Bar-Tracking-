# Power-BI-Department-Progress-Bar-Tracking-
A useful visual to track progress via clustered bar-charts. 

This is really a formating exercise. Naturally, I've made use of clustered bar-charts a number of times when making reports but this output (inspired by the Workout Wednesday week 26 challenge) was mainly about tweaking established presentation staples in a way that offers a bit more aesthetic quality. 

I'll make sure to lean into this design on future projects I work on.
